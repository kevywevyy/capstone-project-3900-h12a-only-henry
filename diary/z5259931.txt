Week 1
We formed our group and decided to tackle Project 7. During the tutorial, we brainstormed
various features together as a group and discussed whether how appropriate and realistic
it was to implement.

Week 2
We created user stories based on the features we discussed last week and begun working
on the Balsamiq wireframes. 

Week 3
Collaborated together on the proposal and worked on setting up the frontend of the Project
and researching the tools we were planning to use.

Week 4
Continued setting up the frontend (handling API calls) and getting familiar with Material UI
on the frontend, implemented the login and register pages

Week 5
Finished up the rest of the pages such as viewing properties, adding properties, editing
properties and listing properties
