Week 1
We formed our group of 4 and as a team, we decided on completing project 7 (rental inspection system) for this term.
As a group, we then brainstormed a draft of the features that we were going to implement within the project,
which included the 2 novel features as required within the specifications.

Week 2
As a group, we created a basic draft of the user stories that we were going to use for this project. We also discussed
and answered any questions within our group to ensure that we all had the same idea in mind. During the week, I also
helped create a draft acceptance criteria for each user story, which as a group, we discussed and finalised what the final
acceptance criteria would be.

Week 3
We collaborated together for the proposal by splitting certain parts of the proposal to each team member and worked on
getting familiar with Docker and Spring (both which I had never used before).

Week 4
I started on working on the backend of estates which included a DB schema, Controller for the API endpoint, a DAO and
Models for registration and editing of estates. The initial implementation ended up needing to be changed after a group
decision on how we were going the requests in the backend.

Week 5
I finished implementing the estates as part of RIS-9 and fixed any outstanding bugs that arose from the development
process to ensure it passed integration tests.
